# SpellingBee
My Implementation of the 2022 Nifty Spelling Bee Assignment.

Based off the assignment given [here](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2022/eroberts-spelling-bee-wordle/), which in turn was based off the NYT's Spelling Bee game.

My goal with this project was to have a bit of fun and to brush up a little on Java and software engineering thinking. Interesting things I encountered while working on it include:

- OOP Thinking
- Type management
- Lambda Expressions
